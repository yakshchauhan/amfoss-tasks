First we created three file in in "TASK-03" folder than make three file - index.html, style.css, script.js .
now import default template and make give classe's and id's to your elements .Import audio (e.g. fail, success , drawsound, narration parts,bg musics) , overlay logo etc.
Set body for your webpage give desired design and place to score board , text, game container, canvas,optimus face. Also set overlay for your loading page.
Now import your text , logo, audios, canvas etc using ID's .We have to add narration audios in sequence but before that add lock to everything before narration ended.Now start writing your drawing logic and start pushing your points to arrays so that we can later use them for circle accuracy calculations. Write code for circle checking calculations and show score and updating best score.
In last i also added some animations to my boring text showing on my webpage.
