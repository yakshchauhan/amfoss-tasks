## **INTRODUCTION**
Hi, I am Yaksh Chauhan, a first-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. Even though I am just starting out, I am always eager to learn new things.
## **Why should we choose you**
I secured an AEEE rank of 397 and could have easily taken CSE at Coimbatore campus, but I decided to come Amritapuri because of amFOSS. I believe this shows my genuine passion and commitment to being part of this club. I am the type of person who, once I set a goal, gives my best to achieve it. I am ready to invest my time, energy, and dedication to contribute meaningfully to the club’s growth.
## **How do you intend to contribute back to the club?**
To be honest, as a beginner I may not know exactly how I will contribute right now. But what I can guarantee is that I will actively participate in all events, tasks, and activities of the club. I am always willing to put in the effort to learn, grow, and help wherever needed. Most importantly, I am here for the long run i will not leave midway. Instead, I will stay consistent, keep learning, and contribute as much as possible over time.
## **What are your fields of interest,and how do you plan on working on them?**
At present, I don’t have a fixed field of interest, because I am open to exploring different areas of computer science.But for now i am thinking of creating something similar to the ‘God’s Eye’ shown in Furious 7, after getting into the club. This project would extensively involve AI/ML domains like computer vision, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and IoT, which makes it an exciting challenge to explore.For that, I am looking forward to learn from the peers and mentors in the club. At the same time, I will stay open to new opportunities, challenges, and technologies that come my way in the future.
